:: Ignition ::

Python web application creator

Ignition is a stack creator for Python web applications.  It will create
the Python project (currently only Django), a uWSGI start script, and 
a config file to launch Nginx as the frontend.  It will also create startup
and shutdown sample scripts for launching the stack.

Example:

To create a Django project called 'helloworld' listening on port 80, running under the user 'nginx', and located in /srv/projects:

./ignite.py -d /srv/projects -n helloworld -u nginx -p 80 -t django

You can then 'cd' into /srv/projects/scripts and run:

sudo ./helloworld_start.sh

Visit http://localhost in your web browser and you should see the standard 'It works!' Django page.
